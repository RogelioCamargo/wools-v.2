## Warehouse Tools

### Demo
https://roger-wools.herokuapp.com/

This is the more redefined version of an earlier attempt to solve an issue. [See First Design](https://github.com/RogelioCamargo/inventory-solutions).

Technologies and services: 
1. Node.js
2. React
3. Redux
4. MongoDB and mongoose
5. Bootstrap

What's better? 
I switched to React. I followed the MVC design pattern for the first project but found development to be really slow.
It was difficult to implement simple features. When I moved to react, I found adding new features and keeping my code nice and modular much easier.
